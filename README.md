__________________________________________________Student Exam Performance Prediction_________________________________________________

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on their study hours and previous exam scores. It utilizes a logistic regression model to perform this binary classification task.

*Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that can help predict student performance in exams, which can be valuable for educators and students to understand the impact of study habits on exam results.

*Features

- Study Hours: Number of hours the student studied for the exam.
- Previous Exam Score: The score the student achieved in their previous exam.
- Pass/Fail: The target variable indicating if the student passed (1) or failed (0) the exam.

*Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

*How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Student_Exam_Performance_Prediction.ipynb`) to see the code in act*ion.

*Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to educational data to make predictions about student performance. It serves as a foundational step for more complex analyses and improvements in predictive accuracy.
